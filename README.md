# React-With-TS-Sites-Relaunch

I am re launching my sites with TS instead of JS and doing a ground up rebuild with the front and back end.
I will be at the end packing my front and back into seperate docker containers.

A live demo is up on my VPS, project is far from complete but it can be found at at : https://devdylan.me
