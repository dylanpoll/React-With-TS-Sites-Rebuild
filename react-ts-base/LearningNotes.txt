about chakra-ui 
  kind of like bootstrap, its just a starter pack for react with a few good components that make front end a bit
faster to deploy.

Notes :

ISSUES WITH EMOTION/CORE -> EMOTION/REACT : boils down to a dependency declaration issue, many have this issue 
https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/issues/1606 -> old thread where the issue keeps being re stated, on the issues page of the repo many new listings still show it.
article talking about options other than emotion/core -> https://colinhacks.com/essays/emotion-core-vs-vanilla-emotion
will use it to complete tutorial but after that will probably change to something else. 
uninstalling installed packages and using :   yarn add @emotion/core@10.1.1

--React 
for any TS files that have react code we label them .tsx 

--nextJS
IN NEXTJS all file names within the pages folder will be a route we can use based on the file name.
a video covering basic information about the technology : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sklc_fQBmcs

--formik
formik is kind of broken atm with the current release and when the tutorial was made it seems.

--urql graphQL
https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/
this is being used to hook our graphQL instance to our website.

--graphQL code generator
yarn add -D @graphql-codegen/cli
this is used to make react hooks easily.


General JS/TS/REACT
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment
hooks -> const [,] = example(); are using array deconstruction  
position one or two may or may not be filled in however that is only stating that the object at the array position left blank is unused and will likely have a value pulled from elsewhere.

 <h1><a href="https://creepcript.rip/">  CreepCript.RIP  </a>{'\n'}</h1>
        I have a friend who is and has been stalked online for a long time. 
                    This project is dedicated to that friend and meant to help people who are being harrased in that same way.{'\n'}
                {'\n'}The project can accomplish :
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Injection of metadata(exif data codes meant to be used for tracking suspect leads)</span></li>
                        <li><span>Image Stegnography as a means to inject a tracking code to bypass exif data scrubbers</span></li>
                        <li><span>An easy deploment system ( so you can host a site that will post images that will automatically display tagged images for the user connected.)</span></li>
                        <li><span>A phone App</span></li>
                        <li><span>Archival for people to codes used only accessable after authenticating using Auth0.</span></li>
                        <li><span>And more.(site is under development, but the backend is almost done.)</span></li>
                        <li><span>GitHub Repo : <a href="https://github.com/dylanpoll/CreepCript.RIP">/CreepCript.RIP</a></span></li>

                this currently is being built, the only remaining issue is with the email scanning system. it is over scanning and erasing old results.
                
                <li><span>I plan to work this from a ESP32 down to a ESP01 in the future.</span></li>
                <li><span>Working on listening for windows push notifications and using those as ques for light animations</span></li>
                <li><span>last future expansion will be to default back to the old LED scheme state after ending that animation, this will be done by recording the state and pushing the animation as a temporary state and setting it back to the original upon completion.</span></li>

                <span><li>the Karma bot is just a part of my larger Karma project, a lot of its features are tied to the database it works with and the express rest API it is using. see the karma project repo or my rest API repo for a better explonation.</li></span>

                <span><li>runs a python script that checks for the mac addresses of devices connected to your network.</li></span>
                <span><li>It uses Nmap for this. </li></span>
                <span><li>It runs those addresses against a list of addresses and if the address listed is present it sends a char to an arduino by using serial communications.</li></span>
                <span><li>the arduino controls a LED strip and when it recieves a char it has an associated color for that device and it lights the LEDs for that person based on them being present.</li></span>
